 - stop dmenu prompts from blocking the GTK mainloop. This could be done with
   threads, but doing it with async stuff would be better.
 - More test coverage.
 - Site-specific searches, e.g. 'pb' for piratebay. Having a way to view/edit
   these would be nice too.
 - Window close undo.
 - Cookie filtering/management.
 - Cookie jar encryption.
 - Password manager (groundwork for this has been done).
 - Downloads page (rather than dmenu navigation)
 - Better UI regarding in progress downloads, HTTP/HTTPS, etc.
