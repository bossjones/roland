 - stop dmenu prompts from blocking the GTK mainloop. This could be done with
   threads, but doing it with async stuff would be better.
 - More test coverage.
 - Site-specific searches, e.g. 'pb' for piratebay. Having a way to view/edit
   these would be nice too.
 - Window close undo.
 - Cookie filtering/management.
 - Cookie jar encryption.
 - Password manager (groundwork for this has been done).
 - Downloads page (rather than dmenu navigation)
 - Better UI regarding in progress downloads, HTTP/HTTPS, etc.
 - Tooltips (display link under mouse)
 - Display URLs in follow mode, display links for frames.
 - Follow mode doesn't adjust positioning as you scroll down the page.
 - handle sub-par URIs, e.g. "github.com/nathan-hoad/roland", without scheme
 - lazy tabs
