 - stop dmenu prompts from blocking the GTK mainloop. This could be done with
   threads, but doing it with async stuff would be better.
 - Handle popup windows. A function from config.py to decide whether or not it
   should open them would be nice.
 - More test coverage.
 - Site-specific searches, e.g. 'pb' for piratebay. Having a way to view/edit
   these would be nice too.
 - Window close undo.
 - Password manager (groundwork for this has been done).
