 - More test coverage.
 - Cookie filtering/management.
 - Cookie jar encryption.
 - Downloads page (rather than menu navigation)
 - Better UI regarding in progress downloads, HTTP/HTTPS, etc.
 - Tooltips (display link under mouse) (mouse-target-changed signal)
 - lazy tabs
 - Live-syncing tabs between machines would be pretty cool.
 - set preferable languages
 - logging
 - pinned tabs

Webkit2 Port
 - web process is smashing CPU on shutdown?

Password manager fixes:
 - smart form fills for names and credit cards and such?
 - synchronisation command for putting the database somewhere remote
   this needs to be generic and user-implemented because i'm not hosting a
   password manager service
 - form fill page on load (can be disabled)
 - if a form was filled, but submitted with different information to what's
   stored, offer to update a record
 - interface to manage the store.


Live Syncing
 - lan only? That would certainly be the easiest.
 - DTLS broadcast when:
   - a new tab opens up.
   - is closed.
   - navigation occurs
 - SSDP for finding other rolands?
 - windows would need strictly incrementing IDs.
 - TLS
 - Would need a method of resolving network separation, would need to merge
   changes? :/
