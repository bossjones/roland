 - More test coverage.
 - Site-specific searches, e.g. 'pb' for piratebay. Having a way to view/edit
   these would be nice too.
 - Cookie filtering/management.
 - Cookie jar encryption.
 - Password manager (groundwork for this has been done).
 - Downloads page (rather than menu navigation)
 - Better UI regarding in progress downloads, HTTP/HTTPS, etc.
 - Tooltips (display link under mouse) (mouse-target-changed signal)
 - lazy tabs
 - Live-syncing tabs between machines would be pretty cool.
 - set preferable languages
 - logging
 - colored prompt

Webkit2 Port
 - web process is smashing CPU on shutdown?
 - initialise the webextensions with a secret key, so any old process can't
   talk to roland via dbus.

Password manager fixes:
 - form fill shouldn't overwrite prefilled fields, maybe?
 - generate-password command needs to take parameters for mixed case,
   punctuation, numbers and length
 - smart form fills for names and credit cards and such?
 - synchronisation command for putting the database somewhere remote
   this needs to be generic and user-implemented because i'm not hosting a
   password manager service
 - form fill page on load (can be disabled)
 - if a form was filled, but submitted with different information to what's
   stored, offer to update a record
 - interface to manage the store.
